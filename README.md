# Network-Security-Labs
This repository contains hands-on enterprise network security labs focused on how real-world network design decisions create or prevent attack paths.

The emphasis is not on isolated exploits, but on understanding:
- How traffic flows through enterprise networks
- How attackers move laterally after an initial compromise
- Where segmentation, routing, and access controls fail
- Why detection and visibility often break down
- How to mitigate these issues through better design

These labs are intentionally aligned with CCNP-level networking concepts and attack-informed security principles.

## Lab Themes

- Enterprise network design and segmentation
- Lateral movement and attack path analysis
- Network misconfigurations and trust boundary failures
- Detection gaps in east-west traffic
- Security-focused network hardening and mitigation

## Labs

### Flat Network Lateral Movement
Explores how a flat enterprise network enables unrestricted lateral movement and why detection is ineffective without proper segmentation and monitoring.

*(Additional labs will be added as complexity increases.)*

---

## Goal

Develop deep, practical understanding of how attackers exploit network design weaknesses and how defenders can realistically detect and mitigate those behaviors.

This repository prioritizes clarity, reasoning, and real-world relevance over tooling or exploit novelty.
