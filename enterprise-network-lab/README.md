# Enterprise Network Lab

This lab simulates a realistic enterprise network scenario designed to practice **network engineering and security concepts**.

---

## Lab Overview

- 4 departments: HR, Finance, Sales, Engineering (3 workstations each)  
- Remote VPN access  
- DHCP, DNS, and IP helper configuration  
- Inter-VLAN routing  
- ACLs enforcing traffic security  

This setup mirrors **real-world enterprise network challenges** and reinforces hands-on skills for network engineers.

## Lab Goals

1. Demonstrate DHCP assignments across multiple VLANs  
2. Validate inter-VLAN routing  
3. Implement and test ACLs for security enforcement  
4. Practice troubleshooting network issues
