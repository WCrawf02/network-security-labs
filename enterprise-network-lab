# Enterprise Network Lab

This lab simulates a realistic enterprise network scenario designed to practice **network engineering and security concepts**.  

---

## Lab Overview

- 4 departments (HR, Finance, Sales, Engineering), each with 3 workstations  
- Remote VPN access  
- DHCP, DNS, and IP helper configuration  
- Inter-VLAN routing  
- ACLs enforcing traffic security  

This setup is designed to mirror **real-world enterprise network challenges** and to reinforce hands-on skills for network engineers.

## Lab Goals

1. Demonstrate DHCP assignments across multiple VLANs  
2. Validate inter-VLAN routing  
3. Implement and test ACLs for security enforcement  
4. Practice troubleshooting network issues

## Key Features

- **DHCP**: Automatic IP assignment per VLAN  
- **Inter-VLAN Routing**: VLAN communication controlled through SW-CORE  
- **ACLs**: Restrict traffic between departments while allowing essential server access  
- **Simulation**: Packet Tracer-ready with pre-configured settings
